            <p>Today was very interesting.  Here is some things we've done:
        </div>    
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First, Steve gave us an orientation presentation.  We 
                    introduced ourselves to each other and met our teachers and 
                    staff members.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We spent a good part of the morning loading all the 
                    programs and resources we'll need onto our computers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The last half of the day was spent learning about git 
                    and github.  We learned to link a project to github.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
